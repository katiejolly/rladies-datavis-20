# But where to start...

---
### 30 days of maps

1. Points

2. **Lines** &larr; (we are here!)

3. Polygons

4. Hexagons...

### What are some lines I can think of quickly?

--
* Transportation routes (bus/train/ferry/etc.)

--

* Elevation

--

* Roads

--

* Origin-destination data

--

* Joyplots

# Design time

(I chose elevation & the train route-- so many lines!)

# Consider your audience `r emo::ji("smile")`

1. Who is your audience?

  * I was sharing my maps on Twitter and most of my followers are also R users and have some familiarity with the geography of the US

2. How is your audience viewing your work?

  * On Twitter, which means I need to be mindful of image size and color for the best viewing experience

3. What do you want them to learn from it?

  * The biggest takeaway should be how quickly the elevation changes along the route and how different each end is

# Add labels `r emo::ji("pencil")`

Annotations can:

* Guide your readers to the main point

* Provide additional context

* Reiterate important points

But... *less is more!*

I chose to use a few Amtrak stations along the way to anchor the route in recognizable places.

Especially when sharing on social media, your title should be short and catchy! 

**When working on a tight timeline I like to use Illustrator/Inkscape to add labels**
